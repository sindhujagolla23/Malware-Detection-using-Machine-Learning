# Malware-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project involves building a machine learning model to detect malware using various features extracted from executable files. The model is trained on a dataset of malware samples and their corresponding features. The dataset used in this project contains various features of executable files that can be used to distinguish between benign and malicious software. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, which is assumed to be compressed.
